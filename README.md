# DDTCN-Decomposed Dimension Time-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Along Spatial Dimensions for Multiple Long-Term Series Forecasting
We extensively evaluate our model and compare it with traditional time series forecasting methods as well as several benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in most tasks of multivariate time series prediction.
Our code is coming soon.
